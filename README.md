# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

### Name: Jumer Ryan Caragay
- No Nickname, other than my first name is Jumer

### Status: Complete

### Compliation/Execution Instruction
  - The files piku.s must be present in the directory
  - Inside the directory, run the command below to compile the program
```
gcc -o piku piku.s
```
  - After compiling your code, you can run the program via
  ```
  ./piku
  ```
  - The ouput should be displayed

### Issues
- No issues encountered along the way. I'm curious when calling printf, what happens if you pass in extra strings in R1-R3 which are also argument registers, do they get ignored or used?
